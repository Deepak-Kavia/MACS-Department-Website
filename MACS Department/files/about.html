                            The Department of   Mathematics (today called, the Department of Mathematical and   Computational Sciences) started along with the institute(1960).  The Department of Mathematical and Computational Sciences, formerly known as Department of Mathematics, is one of the oldest departments of NITK. The department initially catered to the needs of the UG and PG Engineering   Mathematics and subsequently, in 1988-89, introduced two PG programmes, namely, the Master of Computer Applications (MCA) and Master of Technology (M.Tech.) Computational  Mathematics (CMA) (earlier named Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Systems Analysis and Computer Applications).

                            The PG programme, Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Computational  Mathematics (CMA)  is replaced with Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Computational and Data Science(CDS) since 2019.

                                MACS Department is known for its variety of courses in the areas of Algebra, Analysis, Applied Mathematics and Statistics. It not only caters to the needs of the other 13 departments of NITK but also offers its own masterâ€™s program in computer applications and computational mathematics. People from across the country come and enroll to the PhD program with faculties having expertise in the areas of Computational Systems, Nonlinear Analysis, Functional Analysis, Real Analysis, Number Theory & Cryptography, Numerical Analysis, Graph Theory, Optimization, Fluid Dynamics, Computer applications, Image  processing and many more.
